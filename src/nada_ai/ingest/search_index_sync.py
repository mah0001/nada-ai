"""Reconcile the search index against NADA's ``search-index`` change queue.

NADA (as of the ``catalog-admin`` OpenAPI spec, tag ``Search index``) tracks a
change queue for keeping one external search index in sync with the catalog:
every study create/update/delete enqueues a row. This module polls that queue,
applies each change to our own index/collection, and acks it back — so a
missed webhook, a restart, or a cold start can all catch up by polling instead
of needing a full re-ingest.

Endpoints used (admin API key required, ``X-API-KEY``):

- ``GET  {base}/admin/search-index/status``          — queue/state counts
- ``GET  {base}/admin/search-index/queue``            — list pending/failed items
- ``POST {base}/admin/search-index/queue/{id}/ack``   — ack one item
- ``POST {base}/admin/search-index/requeue``          — retry one item, or reset all failed

Queue item shape (``SearchIndexQueueItem`` in the spec)::

    {
      "id": 123,                    # queue row id — used for ack
      "object_type": "survey",      # or "citation" (not handled here)
      "object_id": 456,             # NADA's internal numeric id
      "object_key": "WLD_2021_...", # the study idno (what we index by)
      "change_class": "upsert_full" | "upsert_partial" | "variables" | "delete",
      "status": "pending" | "failed",
      "attempts": 0,
      "last_error": null,
      "changed": 1732000000,        # unix time — MUST be echoed back on ack
      "fetch_document": true        # false for deletes (tombstone, no document)
    }

The queue item does **not** carry NADA's ``dataset_type`` (survey, geospatial,
timeseries, document, table, image, script, video, timeseriesdb) — only
``object_key``/idno. Since ``nada_ai.ingest`` needs an explicit
``metadata_type`` (indicator, indicator-db, document, geospatial, microdata,
table, script, image, video — see
``ai4data.discovery.metadata.handler.MetadataLoader``) to know which loader to
use, this module looks up each new/changed idno's ``dataset_type`` via the
``search-metadata-extract`` API and maps it. Items whose ``dataset_type`` has
no known mapping are acked as ``failed`` with a clear reason rather than
guessed at or silently dropped — that keeps them visible in NADA's
``/admin/search-index/queue?status=failed`` for a human to resolve, instead of
retrying forever or corrupting the index with a wrong type.
